    <p>To make this flavorful dish, you'll simply cook onions, carrots, cabbage, and potatoes in olive oil seasoned with cumin and turmeric. If you like, add a little ginger and garlic. "My Ethiopian friend brought this dish to a potluck and I've been making it ever since," says stamarex. "It is healthy and delicious. Do not add liquid. The cabbage and potatoes release enough moisture on their own."</p>
