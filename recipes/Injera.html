    <p>Ethiopian food isn't just delicious, it's also fun to eat. The key is injera, the thin fermented flatbread that's both plate and silverware. Pile a variety of stews and cooked vegetables on top, then tear additional pieces of injera to scoop up bite-size portions of the food.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of teff flour (you can also use a combination of teff and other flours like wheat or barley)</li>
        <li>2 cups of water (plus more for soaking)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of active dry yeast (optional, but it helps with fermentation)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to Prepare it </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of teff flour with 2 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Mix well until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter sit at room temperature for about 24 to 48 hours to ferment.</li>
        <li>After the fermentation period, stir the batter gently to incorporate any settled solids at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or a large flat pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the skillet, starting from the center and working your way in a circular motion to create a thin, round injera.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet with a lid and let the injera cook for about 2-3 minutes until small bubbles form on the surface and the edges lift slightly.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked injera from the skillet and transfer it to a plate or clean kitchen towel to cool.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter to make more injera pancakes.</li>
        <li>Allow the injera to cool completely before serving.</li>
      </ol>
